## Rationale

### Project Introduction
An opportunity to bring together events from across the UK to one place, allowing you to be able to check upcoming events in 2025. You will also be able to register/login to your account, where you can add, edit and delete their own events.

### Motivation and Inspiration
Events are happening every day through out the UK and indeed the World. Whether these are National events, sporting events, to Festivals of all sizes. This website gives the opportunity to bring these all together as an easy point of reference to check details or location of the event.

The inspiration for creating this website is to produce an Event log that is accessible to all, that may encourage and introduce users to become attendees to new events around the UK and help educate users on different events going on around the UK.

### Project Scope and Limitations
The scope of the project includes the creation of an Event database with the features focusing on usability on mulitple devices and accessbility for anyone wanting to go to UK Events.

The known limitation is the UK Events website currently just forcuses on next year (2025) and is UK based. To solve this limitation I would expand to other future years with a section for past events and potentially expand to add different locations Worldwide.

## User Experience (UX)

### Site Goals
* I want the user to be able to view the site on a range of device sizes.
* I want the site to be attractive, responsive and easy to use for the user.
* I want the site to work as up-to-date reference point for UK Events.
* I want the user to be educated on Events that they may not know about.
* I want the site to be user friendly and for all ages.

### User Stories

#### Returning/Frequent Visitor Goals

* I want to be able to introduce more users to my events coming up to increase attendances.
* I want to be able to edit my own events.
* I want to be able to delete my own events.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

![UK Events Website Colour Palette](docs/colourpalette.png)

The website uses a palette of blues and reds to depict the Union Jack flag. The colour palette was created using the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website.

### Typography

I have used Fredoka from Google Fonts for this website. I like the round font and I felt it added a little fun to the text. It is a Sans Serif font.

### Imagery

The background image has been picked for it's patriotic look. I have credited this at the end.

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created for mobile, tablet and desktop.
